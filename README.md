# Bebop Lines

*Bebop Lines* is a Python package for generating and manipulating rising/falling systems of melodic cells. It is a utility for creating long, musically meaningful chromatic phrases, i.e., for creating bebop-like melodic lines.

The package uses methods closely related to the [*tone row*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_row)-manipulating techniques of 20th century [*serialism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialism), based on permutation of the order of notes in chromatic scales.

The actions of permutation groups on sequences (of notes) plays a central role in the present package. The package includes tools for implementing group actions and closely related transformations on melodic lines, and tools for printing these lines to either `midi` or `wav` files.


## Purpose and Design

### Bebop lines, serialism, and dense chromatic movement
One central feature of the sorts of melodic lines that appear in bebop horn solos is a predominance of chromatically melodies, often appearing in rising and falling sequences, with pivot tones revealing the underlying key.

Suppose given an arbitrary *scale*, meaning any sequence of $N$ distinct pitches $(p_0,\ p_1,\ p_2,\ \cdots,\ p_{N-1})$ satisfying

$$
p_0\ <\ p_1\ <\ p_2\ <\ \cdots\ <\ p_{N-1}.
$$

The set of all possible melodic cells constituing full runs of the scale is none other than the set of permutations of the pitches in our scale:

$$
\text{Perm}(\{p_0,\ p_1,\ p_2,\ \dots,\ p_{N-1}\})
$$

### The `PermutationBar` class
[...]

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & & 1 & & 2 & & 3 & & 4 & & 5 & & 6 \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow
& & \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
1 & & 0 & & 4 & & 3 & & 5 & & 2 & & 6
\end{array}
$$

Call this permutation $\sigma$. The *graph* of this particular permutation, that is, the set of all pairs $(n,\ \sigma(n))$ in the square $(0,\ 1,\ \dots,\ N-1)\times(0,\ 1,\ \dots,\ N-1)$
