    Converts a list of pitch degrees into a one-hot encoded tensor.

    This function takes a list of integers representing pitch degrees
    (typically MIDI-like values) and converts it into a one-hot encoded
    tensor of shape (128, T), where T is the length of the input list.
    Each column in the resulting tensor represents the one-hot encoding
    of a single pitch degree with 128 possible pitch classes (0â€“127).

        degree_phrase : A list of integer pitch degrees.

            a one-hot encoding of the corresponding pitch degree.
